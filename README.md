# Video Motion Detection Parallelization Project

  

## 1. Introduction

  

The goal of this project is to parallelize the motion detection of a video using two approaches: **Pthreads** and **Fastflow**. The motion detection process involves the following steps:

  

1.  **Grey Filter**: Converts the frame to grayscale.

2.  **Blur Filter**: Applies a blur effect to reduce noise.

3.  **Motion Detection**: Compares the processed frame with the background (initial frame) to detect motion. If the difference exceeds a set threshold, motion is detected.

  

At the end of the execution, the program reports the number of frames that differ from the background. The task is parallelized as a stream problem since the input is a series of video frames, and the goal is to minimize service time.

  

## 2. Approach

  

The project uses a **Farm model** for parallelization, which consists of three stages: grey filter, blur filter, and motion detection. Each stage is computed sequentially within the same thread, which avoids overhead from passing frames between stages and optimizes memory locality.

  

### Service Time Analysis

  

The service time for the farm model is calculated as:

S(Farm) = max { T_read, T_grey + T_blur + T_motion }

  
  

Where:

-  `T_read`: Time to read the frame.

-  `T_grey`, `T_blur`, and `T_motion`: Times for applying the grey filter, blur filter, and detecting motion, respectively.

  

For optimal performance, 1 thread is used for reading and 10 threads for processing the frames in the farm, with the bottleneck at the reading function, resulting in a total service time of 2600.8μs using 11 threads.

  

## 3. Project Structure

  

### Folders

  

-  **Include**: Contains `Functions.hpp` and the `ff` folder.

-  `Functions.hpp`: Defines functions for the grey and blur filters, as well as motion detection.

-  `ff`: Contains headers for the Fastflow library.

-  **Resources**: Includes two video files (720p and 1080p) for motion detection.

-  **Statistics.cpp**: Source file to compute performance metrics.

-  **VideoMotionDetect.cpp**: Main file for motion detection and completion time reporting.

  

## 4. Compilation

  

To compile the project, follow these steps:

  

```bash
$  cd  VideoMotionDetect/
$  mkdir  build && cd  build
$  cmake  ..
$  make
```
  

## 5. Execution

  

There  are  two  executables:  **VideoMotionDetect**  and  **Statistics**.

  

### 5.1 VideoMotionDetect

  

This  program  takes  four  inputs:

  

1.  **Number  of  threads**:  Set  to  `0`  for sequential execution, or a positive integer for parallel execution.

2.  **Fastflow**:  Set  to  `0`  for C++ threads or `1`  for Fastflow.

3.  **Scheduling (ondemand)**: Set to `0`  to  disable  ondemand  scheduling  or  `1`  to  enable  it  for  Fastflow.

4.  **Path  to  video**:  Path  to  the  video  file  to  check  for  motion.

  

**Example**: To run the program with 16 threads using Fastflow and ondemand scheduling on the 720p video:

  

```bash
$ ./VideoMotionDetect 16  1  1 ../Resources/Video720p.mp4
```
  
  

### 5.2 Statistics

This program takes two inputs:
  

1.  **Show video**: Set to `0` to disable video output, or `1` to display the video with motion detection results in the terminal.

2.  **Path to video**: Path to the video file to check for motion.

 
**Example**: To run the program and show the 1080p video:

  

```bash
$  ./Statistics  1  ../Resources/Video1080p.mp4
```
